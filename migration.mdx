# Migration Guide: Deprecation of Jiffyscan API Services

As part of our ongoing efforts to streamline our offerings, we are deprecating our API services. Below are the two alternative approaches you can use to transition seamlessly:

## Option 1: Use Jiffyscan Subgraphs Directly

Jiffyscan provides subgraphs for querying blockchain data directly. Each subgraph corresponds to a specific EVM blockchain.

### Subgraphs

| NETWORK          | Subgraph Name                                                                                          | Subgraph Endpoint                                                                                                             | Subgraph Link |   |

> **Note:** Update the table with accurate links for all subgraphs.

### Querying the Subgraph

Subgraphs allow you to fetch data using GraphQL queries. Below is an example of how to make a query:

#### Sample Query

```graphql
query GetUserOpHash($userOpHash: Bytes) {
  userOps(where: {userOpHash: $userOpHash}) {
    verificationGasLimit
    userOpHash
    transactionHash
    }
}
```

#### Sample `curl` Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "query GetUserOpHash($userOpHash: Bytes) { userOps(where: {userOpHash: $userOpHash}) { verificationGasLimit userOpHash transactionHash } }",
    "variables": {
      "userOpHash": "0x7e4ba0a376476010d3e4ade7b5e5783a74174d3672c620c3148ddcc0f3a58e01"
    }
  }' \
  https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/45842/sepolia-jiffy-scan/version/latest
```

Replace the URL with the appropriate subgraph link for the blockchain you are querying.

## Option 2: Use Our TypeScript Library

We have created a TypeScript library that implements the top two most-used APIs from Jiffyscan. This library is easy to integrate into your projects.

### Resources

* **GitHub Repository:** [Library GitHub](https://github.com/example/jiffyscan-ts-library)

* **npm Package:** [jiffyscan-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jiffyscan-ts)

### Installation

```bash
npm install jiffyscan-ts
```

### Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use the library:

```typescript
import { getTransactionDetails, getBlockDetails } from 'jiffyscan-ts';

(async () => {
  const txDetails = await getTransactionDetails('0xTransactionHash');
  console.log(txDetails);

  const blockDetails = await getBlockDetails(123456);
  console.log(blockDetails);
})();
```

Refer to the GitHub repository for complete documentation and advanced usage.
