Jiffyscan Bundlers are types-safe ERC-4337 bundler written in Typescript.

Our focus is on providing the best developer experience for teams building on Account Abstraction with transaction inclusion speed, full type safety, and transaction inclusion dependability.

Lets get you started to setup your Bundler using Jiffyscan.

<Note>You can take the reference of Jiffyscan Demo repo [here](https://github.com/jiffy-labs/privy-demo/) </Note>

# Bundler Setup

## 0. Refer the repo

Since React has a lot of boilerplate, we will only focus on the Jiffyscan related code. We recommend  ) refer to [quickstart code](https://github.com/jiffy-labs/privy-demo/) if you get lost as you follow along this tutorial.

## 1. Create a Next.js project

In this tutorial, we will be using Next.js. Start by creating a Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## 2. Configure your Auth provider

When building a web3 application, it's crucial to have a robust and user-friendly authentication system. Two popular options for this are [Privy](https://www.privy.io/) and [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io/). Both services offer easy-to-integrate solutions for web3 authentication and wallet management. Let's explore how to use either of these services in your project.
You can go through the guide for Privy or Web3Auth to setup your Auth Provider

## 3. Install necessary dependencies

In your project, install the necessary dependencies from Pimlico, Privy, wagmi and viem & Jiffscan

```bash
npm i permissionless viem wagmi @privy-io/wagmi
pnpm i jiffy-labs/web3a
```

4. Get the API key from Jiffyscan
(You can obtain this from dashboard.jiffyscan.xyz)

## Configuration
First, let's set up the necessary imports and configurations:

```bash
import { ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06, createSmartAccountClient } from "permissionless";
import { createPimlicoBundlerClient } from "permissionless/clients/pimlico";
import { fuse } from "viem/chains";
import { http } from "wagmi";

const jiffyscanKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_JIFFYSCAN_API_KEY as string;
const bundlerUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNDLER_URL as string;

export const CHAINS = [
    {
        name: "Fuse",
        chain: fuse,
        bundlerUrl: bundlerUrl,
        explorerUrl: "https://explorer.fuse.io/tx/",
    },
];
```

### Setting up the Bundler Client
Now, let's create the Bundler client:

```Typescript
const bundlerTransport = http(selectedChain.bundlerUrl, {
    fetchOptions: {
        headers: { "x-api-key": jiffyscanKey },
    },
});

const bundlerClient = createPimlicoBundlerClient({
    transport: bundlerTransport,
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06,
});
```

### Integrating the Bundler with Smart Account Client
Finally, we'll integrate the Bundler with the Smart Account client:

```bash
const smartAccountClient = createSmartAccountClient({
    account: simpleSmartAccountClient,
    entryPoint: ENTRYPOINT_ADDRESS_V06,
    chain: selectedChain.chain,
    bundlerTransport: bundlerTransport,
    middleware: {
        gasPrice: async () => (await bundlerClient.getUserOperationGasPrice()).fast,
        // ... other middleware options
    },
});
```
