title: "AA31: Insufficient Paymaster Funds"
---

<Note>
The paymaster contract address is specified in the first 20 bytes of `paymasterAndData`.
</Note>

The specified paymaster contract lacks sufficient funds in the EntryPoint contract to cover the required prefund for your user operation.

## Resolution Strategies

1. Paymaster Address Verification:
   - Double-check the accuracy of the `paymasterAndData` field
   - Ensure the first 20 bytes correctly represent your intended paymaster contract address

2. For Self-Managed Paymasters:
   - Increase the deposit in the EntryPoint contract
   - Use the paymaster contract's `deposit()` function to add funds

3. For Third-Party Paymaster Services:
   - Reach out to the respective team, if you are using JiffyLabs, [reach out to us](https://t.me/JiffyScan)
