title: "AA24: Signature Validation Failure"
description: "Resolving signature rejection issues in validateUserOp"
---

The smart account's `validateUserOp` function has rejected the user operation's signature.

## Resolution Checklist

1. Signature Accuracy:
   - Verify correct signing of the user operation
   - Ensure proper encoding in the `signature` field

2. UserOpHash Computation:
   - Confirm correct calculation of `userOpHash`
   - Consider using [`getUserOperationHash`](/permissionless/reference/utils/getUserOperationHash)

3. Chain and EntryPoint Verification:
   - Double-check `chainId` and `entryPointAddress` in `userOpHash` computation

4. Smart Account Implementation:
   - Review the signature verification logic in your smart account

5. Advanced Troubleshooting:
   - Employ [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) or similar tools to investigate `validateUserOp` behavior
