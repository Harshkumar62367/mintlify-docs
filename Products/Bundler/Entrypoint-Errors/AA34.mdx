title: "AA34: Paymaster Signature Validation Failure"
description: "Resolving paymaster signature rejection issues"
---

<Note>
  The paymaster contract address is specified in the first 20 bytes of `paymasterAndData`.
</Note>

The paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp` function has rejected the user operation's signature.

## Resolution Checklist

1. For Custom Paymaster Contracts:
   - Verify correct signing of the user operation
   - Ensure proper encoding of the paymaster signature in `paymasterAndData`
   - Confirm correct computation of the custom operation hash
   - Review the signature verification logic in your paymaster

2. For Third-Party Paymaster Services (e.g., JiffyLabs):
   - Avoid modifying user operation fields after paymaster signing (except `signature`)
   - If unmodified but still encountering errors, [contact their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

3. Advanced Troubleshooting:
   - Employ [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) or similar tools to investigate `validatePaymasterUserOp` behavior
