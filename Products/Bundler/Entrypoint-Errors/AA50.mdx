title: "AA50: Paymaster PostOp Reversion"
description: "Addressing issues with paymaster's postOp function"
---

<Note>
  The `postOp` function is called by the EntryPoint on the paymaster contract after user operation execution, often used for additional accounting logic.
</Note>

The paymaster contract's `postOp` function has reverted unexpectedly.

## Resolution Strategies

1. For Custom Paymaster Contracts:
   - Review and correct the `postOp` function implementation
   - If not using `postOp`, ensure the `context` parameter is not set in `validatePaymasterUserOp`

2. For Third-Party Paymaster Services:
   - If using a service like JiffyLabs and encountering this error, [contact their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

3. Advanced Troubleshooting:
   - Investigate `postOp` reversion causes using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
