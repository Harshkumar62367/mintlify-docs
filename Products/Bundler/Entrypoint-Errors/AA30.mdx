<Note>
The paymaster contract address is specified in the first 20 bytes of `paymasterAndData`.

The system cannot locate the specified paymaster contract at the provided address.

## Resolution Steps

1. Paymaster Data Verification:
   - Confirm the accuracy of the `paymasterAndData` field
   - Ensure the first 20 bytes correctly represent your intended paymaster contract address

2. Network Deployment Check:
   - Verify that the paymaster contract is actually deployed on your target network
