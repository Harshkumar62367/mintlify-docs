title: "AA41: Insufficient Verification Gas"
description: "Resolving gas limit issues in account verification"
---

The gas consumed by the smart account's verification process exceeded the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.

## Resolution Steps

1. Gas Limit Increase:
   - Raise the `verificationGasLimit` to cover the gas used by the account's `validateUserOp` function

2. For Bundler Provider Users:
   - If using `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` (e.g., from JiffyScan) and encountering this error, [contact their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

3. Advanced Debugging:
   - Investigate unexpected gas usage in `validateUserOp` using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
