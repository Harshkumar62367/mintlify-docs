title: "AA92: Incorrect EntryPoint Function Call"
description: "Resolving issues with bundler's EntryPoint interaction"
---

The bundler incorrectly attempted to call the EntryPoint's `innerHandleOp` function directly, bypassing the intended `handleOps` function.

## Resolution Checklist

1. For Self-Hosted Bundlers:
   - Review your bundler's interaction with the EntryPoint
   - Ensure all calls are routed through the `handleOps` function

2. For Third-Party Bundler Services:
   - If using a provider like JiffyLabs, [contact their technical support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

By correcting the EntryPoint interaction, you should be able to resolve the AA92 error and ensure proper operation handling.
