<Note>Note: OOG = "Out Of Gas"</Note>

The smart account's `validateUserOp` function encountered an issue:

- It may have reverted unexpectedly
- It may have exhausted its gas allocation

## Troubleshooting Steps

1.  Gas Limit Check:

    - Increase the `verificationGasLimit` to cover `validateUserOp` costs, if it is less.

2.  Logic Verification:

    - Review `validateUserOp` implementation
    - Confirm the user operation's validity

3.  For Non-Paymaster Scenarios:

    - Verify sufficient native tokens in the `sender` address:

    ```typescript
    const neededFunds = calculateRequiredPrefund({ userOperation });
    const accountBalance = await client.getBalance({
      address: userOperation.sender,
    });
    if (accountBalance < neededFunds) {
      throw new Error("Insufficient funds in sender account");
    }
    ```

4.  For Paymaster Usage: - Ensure paymasterAndData is properly set:

    ```typescript
    const opHash = await bundler.sendUserOp({
        paymasterAndData: "0x3b912be0270b59143985cc5c6aab452d99e2b4bb0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000064c0957400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000007d99385d8ef0af67affbf9944df8c121e9d1f6aef8dd82a4aeb5db310c42d3dc5b51c9e0835d94c3b22564d3d94f0e1d14e37571e46651da8de567d128a361a01b",
        // Additional operation details...
    })
    ```
5. Signature Verification:
    - Ensure your implementation doesn't revert for invalid signatures
    - For non-time-sensitive operations, return `uint(1)` for invalid signatures


6. Advanced Debugging:
    - Utilize tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) for in-depth analysis
