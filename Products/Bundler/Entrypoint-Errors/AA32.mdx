title: "AA32: Paymaster Signature Timing Mismatch"
description: "Resolving time-related issues with paymaster signatures"

<Note>
  Note: Jiffyscan's verifying paymaster signatures are valid for 10 minutes by default.
</Note>

The paymaster signature in your `paymasterAndData` field is invalid due to a timing mismatch. This occurs when:

- The current `block.timestamp` exceeds the `validUntil` time
- The current `block.timestamp` is earlier than the `validAfter` time

These constraints are derived from the `validationData` returned by the paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp` function.

## Resolution Strategies

1. For Custom Paymaster Contracts with Time-Based Signatures:
   - Verify `validAfter` and `validUntil` settings
   - Ensure operation submission within the specified timeframe

2. For Custom Paymaster Contracts without Time-Based Signatures:
   - Set both `validAfter` and `validUntil` to `0`

3. When Using Jiffyscan's Verifying Paymaster:
   - Submit the operation within 10 minutes of receiving the paymaster signature
   - For extended validity periods, [contact Jiffyscan support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

By addressing these timing aspects, you'll resolve the AA32 error and ensure smooth paymaster signature validation.
