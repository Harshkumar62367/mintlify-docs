title: "AA22: Time-Based Signature Mismatch"
description: "Addressing timestamp-related signature issues in user operations"
---

Your user operation's signature is invalid due to a timestamp mismatch. This occurs when:

- The current `block.timestamp` is later than the `validUntil` time
- The current `block.timestamp` is earlier than the `validAfter` time

These time constraints are derived from the `validationData` (a `bytes32` field) returned by the smart account's `validateUserOp` function.

## Resolution Strategies

1. For Time-Sensitive Operations:
   - Double-check your `validAfter` and `validUntil` settings
   - Ensure your operation is submitted within the specified timeframe

2. For Standard Operations:
   - Set both `validAfter` and `validUntil` to `0`

<Note>
Pro Tip: For non-time-sensitive operations without aggregators, simplify your `validateUserOp` function:
- Return `uint(0)` for valid signatures
- Return `uint(1)` for invalid signatures
</Note>
