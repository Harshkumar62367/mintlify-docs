The paymaster's `validatePaymasterUserOp` function encountered an issue:
- It may have reverted unexpectedly
- It may have exhausted its gas allocation

## Troubleshooting Steps

1. Gas Limit Check:
   - Increase the `verificationGasLimit` to cover `validatePaymasterUserOp` costs

2. For Custom Paymaster Contracts:
   - Review `validatePaymasterUserOp` implementation
   - Ensure proper signature verification logic (avoid reverting for invalid signatures)
   - For non-time-based signatures, return `uint(1)` for invalid signatures

3. For Third-Party Paymaster Services:
   - If using JiffyScan and encountering issues, [contact their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

4. When Not Using a Paymaster:
   - Ensure the `paymasterAndData` field is not set:

   ```typescript
   const opHash = await bundler.sendUserOp({
     paymasterAndData: "0x",
     // Additional operation details...
   })
   ```
5. Advanced Debugging:
    - Utilize tools like Tenderly for in-depth analysis
