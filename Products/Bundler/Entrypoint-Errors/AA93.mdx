title: "AA93: Invalid PaymasterAndData Format"
description: "Addressing formatting issues in the paymasterAndData field"
---


<Note>
  The paymaster contract address is specified in the first 20 bytes of `paymasterAndData`.
</Note>


The `paymasterAndData` field in your user operation has an incorrect length.

## Resolution Strategies

1. Field Formatting:
   - Ensure `paymasterAndData` is either not set or at least 20 bytes long

2. For Paymaster Service Users:
   - If using a provider like JiffyScan and encountering this error, [contact their support team](https://t.me/JiffyScan)
