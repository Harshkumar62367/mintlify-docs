title: "AA40: Verification Gas Limit Exceeded"
description: "Addressing gas limit issues in account and paymaster verification"
---


The gas consumed during smart account and paymaster verification surpassed the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.

## Resolution Strategies

1. Gas Limit Adjustment:
   - Increase the `verificationGasLimit` to accommodate the actual gas usage

2. For Bundler Provider Users:
   - If using `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` (e.g., from JiffyLabs) and encountering this error, [contact their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

3. Advanced Analysis:
   - Investigate unexpected gas usage with tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
