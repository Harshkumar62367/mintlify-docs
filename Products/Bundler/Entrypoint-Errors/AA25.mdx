title: "AA25: Nonce Mismatch"
description: "Addressing invalid nonce issues in user operations"
---

The `nonce` provided in your user operation is invalid.

## Resolution Strategies

1. Nonce Verification:
   - Ensure you're using the correct current nonce for the smart account and selected `key`
   - Consider using [`getAccountNonce`](/permissionless/reference/public-actions/getAccountNonce)

2. Common Pitfalls:
   - Avoid reusing previously used nonces
   - Don't use nonces too far in the future (no more than 10 ahead of current nonce)

3. Formatting Check:
   - Verify correct nonce format

4. Parallel Transaction Handling:
   - For concurrent operations, utilize custom nonce `key`
   - Refer to [Parallel Transaction Guide](/permissionless/how-to/parallel-transactions##sending-multiple-transactions-in-parallel)

<Note>
Nonce Structure:
The EntryPoint uses a 256-bit nonce, split into:
- 192-bit `key`
- 64-bit `sequence`
Each `key` has its own sequential `sequence`, allowing new `key` introduction with arbitrary values.
