One or more gas values in your user operation exceed the `uint160` size limit.

## Resolution Steps

1. Gas Value Verification:
   - Check all gas limit and gas price fields in your user operation
   - Ensure each value fits within a `uint160`

2. For Bundler Service Users:
   - If the problematic gas values were suggested by a provider like JiffyScan, [reach out to their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)
