title: "AA51: Insufficient Prefund"
description: "Resolving cases where actual gas cost exceeds prefunded amount"
---

The actual gas cost of the user operation exceeded the prefund provided by the smart account or paymaster.

## Resolution Checklist

1. Gas Limit Adjustment:
   - Try increasing the `verificationGasLimit` for the user operation

2. For Bundler Provider Users:
   - If using `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` (e.g., from JiffyScan) and encountering this error, [contact their support](https://t.me/JiffyScan)

3. Advanced Analysis:
   - Investigate discrepancies between actual gas cost and prefund using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/)
